PART II PUBLIC LETTERS

Five Public Letters and Two MandateS‚ 1467-1480

As first chancellor, Scala was responsible for writing all the external letters
of the Florentine government‚ that is, letters sent to rulers, private individ-
uals and Florentine ambassadors outside the Florentine state. One of his
early reforms had been to distinguish between letters ‘of purely public bus-
iness’ and ‘letters of more private business,‘ and many volumes survive of
his drafts presented to the Signoria for approval (in Minutarii 7-17‚ Missive
48, BNF Palat.1103) and of copies of letters despatched after being ap-
proved (Missive 45-47‚49-50).· In view of the great number of letters writ-
ten during hi's chancellorship, no attempt has been made to provide even
a selection of them; instead, the few letters that follow have been chosen
because evidence survives of how they were received, both favourably and
critically. The first two letters (11:1-2) were, according to Alessandro Brac-
cesi, admired by Cardinal Jacopo Ammannati for being ‘restrained‚ serious,
carefully elaborated‚ full of vigour and strength, and polished’—even
though there were some who criticised him for addressing the pope (cor-
rectly, according to classical Latin) in the singular person, not in the plur·
al.*' The third letter (1123) was criticised by the emperor Frederick HI’s
ambassador for over-praising the duke of Milan, but Scala refused to
change it on the grounds that it had already been approved by the Signo-
ria, Colleges and a pratica of citizens ⁶ Similarly his mandate to the Floren-
tine ambassadors to Rome in 1470 (Π; 4, cf. H: ·7) was criticised forits novel-

ty in addressing the pope in the singular and adopting simplified classical,

instead of medieval, formula. In both cases, there were good politica] rea-

sons for the reforms and for the criticism they received. They also, howev-

er, reflect a consistent programme to return to the formula of classical
republicanism‚ according to which the people as sovereign gave commands

⁸ See Scala, 139—45 [96-981, where the problem of distinguishing Scala's own drafts from
those of his assistams is discussed3 for example, the 16 letters, dated May 1466 and April
1467, later copied in Munich‚ staatsbibliothek, Clm.10781 (by Luca Fabiano ἓ see Gentile,
‘Lo Soittoio di Ficino,‘ 379) may or may not be Scala's own work, ibisi„ 141 [106], note 20.

atque roboris plene et expolite,' cf. Scala, 168-70 [1171 and letter 1 below, note a).
