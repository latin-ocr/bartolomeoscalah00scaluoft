Copyists

Scala apparently employed at least five different copyists whom I have
identified as Scribes A, B, C, D and E, at least two of whom can be identi-
fied as chancery scribes. They are as follows:

Scribe A: wrote most of the drafts of letters and poems written in 1481-83
in the Modena notebook (Mo) and in Minutario 11 in 1481-83‚ viz: fols. 12r-
18v (12 135-39‚ 148-56), 21r-24v (1: 124, VI: 34-38)‚ 25r-26v (12 125-29),
followed by a note that four letters of 9 Feb. are entered ‘in minutario
dominorum’ (i.e., Min 11: I: 131-34)‚ 27r-28v, 30r (Iz 140-47), 31v-37r (It 159-
63, 181-84, 173-76). He may also have copied the apologues on fols. 29r-30v„
which are written in a more formal script, as well as five letters in Si⁴ (Iz 164-
68). He is unidentified but is either Scala’s personal secretary, ser Chimenti di
Piero (see I: 177, VIII, 5, Scala, p. 236 [161]), or a chancery scribe who also
copied official letters in Min. 11 and orations in 1481-83 in LC¹, fols. 73v-89r.

Scribe B: ser Pace di ser Bambello, who in July 1482 copied Mo, fol.
31r=v (Iz 158). He was a chancery assistant who also copied letters for
Lorenzo de’ Medici in 1478-80 (Lettere, vols. III and IV passim, esp. IV,
136 and taV. VIII).

Scribe C: wrote the draft of an incomplete letter on 37v (Iz 177), which
was probably composed in 1483.

Scribe D: ser Luca Fabiani, Scala's assistant in the chancery in the 1480s
and 1490s and Marsilio Ficino’s copyist. He almost certainly transcribed
Laur. 68, 26 (Scala's Historia florentinorum), Bi (Apologorum liber secon—
dus), Marc³ (letter 212 to Angelo Poliziano) and two orations (1111 5 and 6).

Scribe E: wrote drafts of letters and a distich in [November] 1496 in
M0,f01s. 1v-2r, 3r-v(1: 221, 223 (part of), 224;V1: 25).

Scala also employed other better-known scribes for the presentation copies
of his writings. L²‚ containing Epistola de sectis philosophorum and
Ducendane sit uxor sapienti (V: 1 and 2), was probably copied by Giovan-
marco Cinico. L5‚ containing his Apologi centum (V: 5) was copied by
