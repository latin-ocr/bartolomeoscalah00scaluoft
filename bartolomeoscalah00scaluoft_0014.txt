x INTRODUCTION

Scala's career and the practical scope of his work as chancellor are
described in my biography, Bartolomeo Scala, 1430-1497, Chancellor ofFlor-
enee: the Humanist as Bureaucrat (Princeton‚ NJ. 1979), henceforth cited as
Scala, page numbers in square brackets referring to the revised edition in
Italian (translated by Lovanio Rossi and Franca Salvetti Cossi, Le Monnier,
Florence, 1990). The biography was originally intended to be accompanied
by an appendix of illustrative documents and unpublished writings. Now,
thanks to Professor Paul Oskar Kristeller’s unstinting help and enthusiasm
and the support of Professor Mario Di Cesare as editor of MRTS, the ap-
pendix has been transformed into an edition of all Scala’s extant writings‚
including a new volume of Apologues, (V: 7) and excluding only the Vita
Vitaliani Borrhomaei and Historia Florentinorum‚ both published in Rome
in 1677.

The opening section contains all the extant letters written by Scala on
his own account, not in his official role as chancellor. Some are originals
—notably his numerous letters to the Medici family preserved in the Medi-
ceo avanti il Principato (MAP) collection in the State Archives in Florence.
Many are autograph drafts preserved in the notebook of his writings in-the
Estense Library in Modena (with others now in Siena and Turin), others
come from chancery volumes of draft letters, or minutari (in the State
Archives in Florence), where they were drafted by himself or by his secre-
taries among the official government letters. These letters show him in
close contact not only with the Medici and political correspondents, but
also with humanists outside Florence like Francesco Filelfo, to whom his
first surviving letter is addressed, and Michele Marullo, the recipient of the
last, undated, letter in the collection. His involvement in the literary devel-
opments of his day is well illustrated by his letters in the 1470s to Bartolo-
meo Platina and Lorenzo de’ Medici about Platina's dialogue De optimo
cive and Lorenzo’s poem, Altercazione. The five official letters and the two
mandates included in section II are intended to illustrate the innovations he
introduced as chancellor, which were both admired and criticized by his
contemporaries, while the official speeches in sections III and IV show an-
other important activity of Scala's, for which we know he was also ad-
mired at the time,

With one exception (the Apologia contra vituperatores Florentiae, V: 8,
written in 1496 to defend Savonarola’s regime against its critics), all the
writings in section V are ‘private,’ not official, compositions. The early
essays (V: 1-4) are important as evidence of teaching in the Florentine
studium and the climate of ideas in Florence at the time when Plato’s Dia-
logues, Lucretius and unfamiliar Hermetic texts were first being read and
commented on, and when new presentations were being made of Aristo—
tle's whole corpus and of the Latin poets Vergil, Juvenal and Persius—all
of which left their mark on Scala’s compositions between 1458 and 1465.
