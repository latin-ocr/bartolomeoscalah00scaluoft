Modena, Biblioteca Estense

Raccolta Campori Appendice 235 (Gamma P. 2.5). A collec-
tion of writings and letters of B. Scala, some autograph‚ [1455-
1496]. Paper, fols. 40. The writings fall into two distinct
groups:

A Copies and drafts of literary compositions in prose and
verse, and of a few letters, mostly in Scala's own hand-
writing. One of the letters (lr) is dated 4 Nov. 1496 and
most of this group is in the handwriting of Scala or his
assistant of the same period; but 6r—v and 38r-40v were
written by Scala as a young man.

B Copies and drafts of letters, 7 Dec. 1481-28 May 1483 and
n.d., and some literary compositions in prose and verse,
mostly in the handwriting of a secretary‚ Scribe A. Five
letters from the middle of this series are preserved in

Siena, Biblioteca Comunale, Autografi Porri, fascio 1725.
There are other autograph drafts of letters, 1474, 1487, in
the Archivio Borromeo, Isola Bella.

The many gaps and dislocations in both groups suggest that
the manuscript was formed by binding a handful of loose
papers from two sources, both 1n disorder, or by rebinding 1n
the wrong order leaves which had once been arranged and
united 1n one or more bound volumes.
