xii INTRODUCTION

Ι make for him in my biography as a reforming and ‘modernising’ chancel—
lor. As his early letters shOW, he was familiar with leading Florentines and
humanists like Francesco Filelfo before being taken up by the Medici; and
before he was appointed chancellor he had proved his effectiveness as a re-
forming chancellor of the Guelf Party. Once in office, his letters are brief
and to the point, never written unless necessary3 and on the rare occasion
he was sent as an emissary outside Florence during the Pazzi War, his
reports in Italian display a lively and incisive narrative style which con·
trasts with his more ponderous Ciceronian Latin (12 69-82). Drafts of his
official letters and humanist writings show how difficult he found it to
write Latin, with changes of mind, misattributions and mistakes. Neverthe-
less, his style as letter-writer and orator was admired in Rome (Iz 31),
where his much-printed Oration to Innocent VIII in 1484 (1112 4) won for
him a papal knighthood. He was also one of the first chancellors to use the
printing press for public propaganda in the 1478 Excusatio florentinorum
(II, 6) and the 1496 Apologia (Vz 8), the Excusatio being printed for circula-
tion throughout Europe. Here Scala was in the vanguard, as in his chan-
cery reforms.

In the chancery his principal concern was to simplify state letters and
protocol. By introducing mandates in the form of letters-patent, signed
only by himself ‘by order of the government’ without notarial attestations
(II, 4 and 7, cf. I: 24, 34, 35), Scala attempted to give practical effect to the
sovereignty of the state, whose will he represented as its public official.
What he, like Machiavelli, admired about the Roman republic was its effec-
tive government—demonstrated, he told Otto Niccolini in 1468 (It 24), by
the Senate and the People—and in his reforms he attempted to strengthen
the powers of the government or ‘state‚’ whether they lay in the hands of
one man like Lorenzo de' Medici or an assembly of men. Although he
may have been less intimate with Lorenzo and his son Piero by the 1490s,
he retained a central role in the regime, as we can see from the fact that in
May 1493, for instance, he was expected to provide Piero with documents
to bolster the reputation of Florence and the Medici in France: ‘not simply
those of the city but also everything relating to your family, such as your
privileges and anything else that is notable.’²

‘Ricordovi quelle informatione dallo Scala non tanto quelle della Citta ma anchora tutte
quelle che sono appartenente alla Casa vostra, come sono i privilegi che havete et quanto al-
tro ὲ occorso che sia notabile.’ Cf. MAP 18‚244‚ Piero Capponi and Guidantonio Vespucci
to Piero de’ Medici, 10 April 1494, describing Capponi‘s chance encounter in Modena with
Piero Tegrimi from Lucca, who wished ‘ci fussi M.Bartolomeo Scala’ to be reminded what
he had once told him about Pietrasanta and Lucca, ‘che era buona spesa per uno castello
aquistare una cita.'
