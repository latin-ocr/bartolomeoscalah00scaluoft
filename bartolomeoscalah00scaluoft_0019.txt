INTRODUCTION xv

by including poems and sermons as well as Scala's other writings. He
emended successive drafts with indefatigable patience and care. Because this
longum opus et arduum owes so much to him, I dedicate it to him in

homage and with affection.

11. EDITORIAL PROCEDURE

Ι have made little attempt to correct Scala or change his style. His Latin
works contain many mistakes (especially in prosody and metrics) and his
Italian texts are idiomatic by later sixteenth-century standards. Where they
exist I follow autograph versions. I have made no attempt to normalize
except in the case of punctuation and the use of capital letters, for which
I have adopted modern practice for salutations‚ dating and months, and in
adjectives derived from place-names (Florentinus, Fiorentino). There is one
exception, letter 224 to Marco Giannarini, where because the punctuation
was corrected by Scala himself, Ι have left it as he corrected it. English
spelling and punctuation has been adopted throughout for the Introduction
and notes to the text.

Latin texts: in general classical orthography has been respected, as it
usually was by Scala on the evidence provided by his autograph writings.
The use of the dipthong has therefore been normalised without respecting
oscillations in the manuscripts between ae and oe; relligio is normalised as
religio; and y has normally been replaced by i in words like sylva, lachry-
ma, sydus, etc.

It should also be noted that in his autograph Scala normally uses the
nasal consonant before q, as in nanque, quanquam, tanquam, etc.

In the case of proper names, by contrast, no attempt has been made to nor-
malise the spelling, even if incorrect.

Italian texts: syntactic doubling has not been retained when words are
split, but, in accordance with current practice, it has been retained when
they are unsplit or unsplittable, as in nollo, evvi.

Fifteenth-century practice has been followed, in accordance with Scala’s
autograph, in the following forms: in the past tense, -amo, -emo, -ebero,
not -am‹m›o, -em‹m›o, -eb‹b›ero; single consonants in aportatore not app-‚
comodo, accomodato, agiunto, magiore, vego; -eza, uzo, not—ezza, -uzzo‚
thus mezo, adirizassi, prezo, poliza3 double consonants in (h)abbino,
(h)abbiamo‚ (h)anno, faccia, debba; ct, tt, pt follow their Latin derivation:
ct not tt in tucti‚ fructi, decto, nocte, pacto, strectamente, proficto, effecto,
auctoritate, octo, Vectori, etc.; tt or t in battaglia‚ lettera, mattina‚ mettere,
Matteo, scrutineo; pt in scripto, concepto, etc., but citta not cipta; cq in
nacque, not naque; sanza not senza; h treated as optional as in (h)avere
forms, but anno (year) not ano or hanno; anchora, hora, not ancora, ora;
but luogo, raccomando, bocca, manca, accade, turcos not luogho, rachom·
