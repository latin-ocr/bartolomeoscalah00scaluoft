INTRODUCTION xiii

Scala, as Poliziano reminded him, was first and foremost a ‘public
scribe’ and funcdonary, not a philologist or scholar, hence the problem we
face in assessing the extent to which his writings as a whole were influ-
enced by professional rhetoric and republican models. There can be no
doubt how pervasive the influence of humanism on him was. It not only
provided him with the professional skills he needed but it more profound-
ly helped to form his whole mentality and culture. For what is striking
about this assemblage of writings is the integrated outlook they reveal‚
whatever the purpose or genre. The traits of Scala’s mature personality can
already be identified in his early writings—mostly, but not totally, stoic
and not distinctively christian-but it was not until the 1480s that his iron-
ic voice finds its mature expression in his dialogues, poems and fables: allu-
sive and pithy‚ they provided the vehicle for his changing ideas on life and
death until his own death in 1497. In the practice ‘Oration on justice' of
1452 (IV : 1, presumably by Scala) and in his later writings, myths are con-
sistently treated as accounts of early man and natural law is regarded as the
unifying force underlying diverse customs and religions. These attitudes
supply the structures for his outlook, and even when modified in the
1490s, when nature emerges in a more protean guise, Scala still retains clas-
sical images as vehicles for his imaginative and often unconventional ideas.

This is the context in which to interpret his claim to ‘the immortality
that comes from a life devoted to the administration of a republic,’ as he
wrote to Lorenzo in 1474 (Ix 49). For, he said, letters are more immortal
than ‘those superior beings which some defend' and they alone survive
when everything else dies and disappears. Although a platitude of Renais-
sance humanism, this claim to immortality through letters is as potentially
challenging to religious orthodoxy as some of Scala's other ideas. How to
interpret it we cannot knOW‚ but if needed, this edition of his writings
will, Ι hope, lay his shade to rest and ensure for him the immortality he
looked forward to as ‘a lettered man.'

In the course of preparing this edition, I have received help in different
ways from very many people. I owe a special debt of gratitude to the late
Julian Brown, to David Chambers, Julian Chrysostomides, Tilly dela Mare,
Bill Kent, Jill Kraye and J.B. Trapp for the support and encouragement
they have generously given me over many years. I have received valuable
assistance in transcribing letters 69-73 and 75-82 from Gino Corti. And
among the many friends and scholars who have told me about, discussed
with me, or provided me with Scala material, I would especially like to
thank Vanna Arrighi, Robert Black, Humphrey Butters, Paula Clarke,
Riccardo Fubini, Luca Gatti‚ Paul Gehl, James Hankins, David Marsh,
George McClure, Michael Mallett, Shayne Mitchell, Andrea Moroni, Paola
Peruzzi, Piergiacomo Pisoni, Marcella Roddewig, Lovanio Rossi, Nicolai
Rubinstein and Sonja Taran. I am also indebted to the many curators of
