INTRODUCTION

1. PREFACE

Bartolomeo Scala was born on 17 May 1430. He was the son of a miller
who lived near Colle Va] d’Elsa, a subject town in the Florentine territory.
After early schooling in Colle, he attended the university of Florence,
where he qualified as a lawyer. After a year in the Borromeo household in
Milan in 1454-55‚ he returned to Florence to become secretary to Pierfran-
cesco de’ Medici, Cosimo’s nepheW, and in 1459 chancellor of the Guelf
Party. By now an intimate of the Medici family, he was appointed first
chancellor of Florence a year after Cosimo’s death in 1464, supported not
only by Cosimo’s son Piero but also by his university companions. In this
position, he rapidly won social and political honours that ensured a posi—
tion of importance for him in Florence. He was granted citizenship in Sep-
tember 1471 and was elected a prior of the Signoria in 1473. Five years ear-
lier he had married into the prosperous merchant family, the Benci‚ and
just before his election as prior he began to acquire the estate in Borgo
Pinti where Giuliano da San Gallo built him an elegant town house
all ’antica. It was there, as he put it, that ‘I have built and spent my money’
—his expenses, as we know from a recently-discovered account-book,
including not only the cost of the house itself but also a parrot-cage and
arsenic ‘to poison the mice’, as well as many clothes, trimmings and dolls
for Maddalena his wife.¹ He was knighted by the pope in Rome in 1484
and received the top political honour in Florence when he was elected
Gonfalonier of justice in 1486, subsequently becoming a member of the
all-important Council of Seventy. Although dismissed from office on 28
December 1494, seven weeks after the fall of the Medici, he was appointed

co—chancellor of the new republican regime only three days later and died
in office on 24 July 1497.
