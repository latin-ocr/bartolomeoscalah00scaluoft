INTRODUCTION xi

More original and important as expressions of his maturer writing are the
Apologi centum of 1481 (V ε 5) the dialogue On laws and legal judgements of
1483 (νε 6), which predates Poliziano's interest in Justinian’s Pandects, and
a newly—discovered volume containing a second hundred Apologues, or
fables‚ of the middle 1480s (νε 7). Some of the ideas expressed here are
reflected in the poems he wrote throughout his life, mostly short eclogues
and distichs but also including one very long poem On trees (V1: 5), which
shows the influence of Vergil, Lucretius and Columella. The final sections,
VII and VIII, contain three confraternity sermons delivered by Scala and a
collection of documents illustrating his life.

Although I have contrasted Scala’s ‘private' and official writings, it is in
practice impossible to separate his public career from his private life, as his
letters illustrate very clearly. Nor is it always easy to distinguish Scala’s
official rhetoric as ‘legitimizing discourse’ or propaganda—evident in so
many of his more formal letters and his orations—from the intimate lan-
guage of his poems and obscure fables. Pius II's comment is well known,
that Florentine chancellors were exceptional in being trained as orators and
humanists rather than as lawyers. So we will not be surprised by the influ-
ence of classical rhetoric and literature on Scala’s writing. Nevertheless‚
this creates the problem for his readers of establishing his authentic voice.
How much of his output was produced as official propaganda, not to be
taken at face value, and how far were even his more personal writings
influenced by literary models or genres ? By assembling so many different
types of writing in one volume, it is hoped that this edition will help to
integrate Scala’s contrasting public and private faces, his language providing
the key to understanding him as a whole.

The predominant theme of the early letters, as well as of Scala’s testa-
ment (VIII: 7), is his close relationship with the Medici. As a miller's son
from Colle, on the borders of the Tuscan state, Scala benefited from Medi-
ci patronage to enter the circles of power in Florence; and once there, he
found himself playing the role of middle man between the centre and the
provinces. He also acted as a link in communicating semi-officially with
ambassadors and with neighbouring regimes about matters that could not
be publicly recorded: palms greased, or ‘syruped,' and favours granted. The
letters provide evidence of the language of patronage and friendship which
has until recently been too little studied; he was servile to patrons like the
Medici or pope Innocent VIII from whom he sought personal favours (Ιε
199, 202), and ironic when seeking or dispensing favours for new men low-
lier than himself or for provincials from his home town (Iz 55). Here, in
contrast to his public ‘open’ utterances (as in the printed Excusatio Floren-
tinorum, II: 6), the emphasis is on the need for discretion and secrecy
(perche stia piu secreto’, I: 120).

Scala’s position as a Medicean client is quite consistent with the claim
