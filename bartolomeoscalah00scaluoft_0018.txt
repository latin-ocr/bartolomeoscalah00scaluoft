xiv INTRODUCTION

libraries harbouring Scala material, among whom Ι remember with par·
ticular gratitude the curators of the University Libraries in Bologna and
Genoa‚ the Biblioteca Comunale in Siena, the Vatican Archives and
Library‚ the Biblioteca Marciana in Venice, the Biblioteca Comunale Guar—
nacciana in Volterra, and above all, in Florence, the librarians and staff of
the Archivio di Stato‚ the Biblioteca Nazionale‚ the Biblioteca Riccardiana
and the Biblioteca Laurenziana‚ where I was inducted into the art of read-
ing manuscripts. To Count Vitaliano Borromeo, the late Marchese Piero
Guicciardini and Marchese Lorenzo Niccolini da Camugliano I am indebt-
ed for permission to publish letters in their family libraries. 1 received
early and generous help from Alessandro Perosa and Lucia Cesarini Marti-
nelli in editing the long poem De arboribus, as well as from the late Guido
Martellotti‚ a former editor of the Nuova Collezione di Testi Umanistici
e Rari.

This edition would never have been completed‚ however, without the
exceptional generosity of several scholars who have devoted their time and
expertise to editing and revising the texts, especially the poems of Scala,
with which Ι was unqualified to deal. Scaevola Mariotti and Silvia Rizzo
were responsible for revising the Latin poems (VIz 1-30)‚ and Domenico
De Robertis‚ with the assistance of Francesco Lo Monaco, the Italian
poems (V12 31-39). Martin Davies meticulously revised sections I—V‚ VI, 1
and VIII; and my colleague J.B. Hall helped to revise the remaining Latin
prose texts (VI: 2-8). Guido Bonsaver and Francesca Chiarelli heroically
and expertly helped to copy the final typescript on to disk. All of this has
made the edition a common enterprise. In the end, it owed its publication
to the warm support and encouragement of Mario Di Cesare, editor of
MRTS, and to the scrupulous editing of John Monfasani‚ helped by funds
provided by the British Academy, the Renaissance Society of America and
the Isobel Thornley Bequest in London University. I would like to express
my deep gratitude to them all, especially to Mario Di Cesare and John
Monfasani, as well as to the administrator of the Isobel Thornley Bequest,
Patricia Crimmin‚ for responding so warmly to the proposal and for enab-
ling it to be brought to fruition. To the British Academy my debt is
particularly great, since it has supported this edition from its inception to
its final publication.

There is one person who for a long time bore this edition on his shoul-
ders, Paul Oskar Kristeller. After replacing Guido Martellotti on his death
as an editor of the Nuova Collezione di Testi Umanistici Inediti e Rari
(published by the Scuola Normale di Pisa), where this book was intended
to be published, Paul Kristeller acted as my mentor and friend. He suggest-
ed material‚ often generously providing me with new texts he had discov-
ered in the course of his work on successive volumes of the Iter Italicum,
and it was he who urged me to make the edition as complete as possible
